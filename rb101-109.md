## local variable scope, especially how local variables interact with method invocations with blocks and method definitions
- A variable is something that is pointing to an object (string, array or hash).
- A local variable’s scope is the block, method definition or program (whichever is ‘smaller’) in which it was first defined. Meaning it is a variable that is initialized inside a block, method body or construct. 
- If a varable was initialized outside a block or a method then we can call that variable inside a block or method. If it was initialized inside a block or method then it can only be used inside that block or method and not anywhere else. 

Ex. 
a = 3
b = a + 3
puts b
# => 8

Since there are no blocks or methods in this program, 'a' scope is simply the entire program in which was defined. 

loop do 
  a = 3
  break 
end 
puts a
# => undefined local variable

Since 'a' is being initialized inside the loop method, the program will raise an error. We would have to initialize it before/outside the loop method in order to use it inside.

# Local variables w/ method invocations.
- If we initialized a method w/ the def keyword somewhere in our program we can then call on that method in a block or another method.
- method invocations (each, select, map) all start a block. We have to initialize the variable outside/before the method gets called in order to use it inside the method block. 

Ex.
a = [1, 2, 3]

a.each { |num| puts num + b }
# => undefined local variable

Some exceptions
---------------
- 'for loops' are part of the main program and ‘do’ and ‘end’ do not define a block. The scoped variable gets extended throughout the entire program.
- 'if' statements have a similar situation where it is part of the main program.

## Mutating vs Non-mutating methods, pass-by-reference & pass-by-value
- Mutating methods is when a method performs a modification to the original object. 
- Non-mutating methods only modify the copies of the original object while the original stays the same. 

# Pass-by-reference & Pass-by-value

==================================================================================================

## Variables as pointers

Ex. 1 non-destructive method calls
----------------------------------
a = 'hi there'    # a is initialized to 'hi there'
b = a             # b is initialized to 'hi there'
a = 'not here'    # a is reassigned to 'not here'
p a               
=> 'not here' 

Variable 'a' is initialized to the object "hi there". Variable 'b' is initialized to 'a' which is assigned to 'hi there'. 2 varibales (a and b) and 1 object ('hi there'). Variable 'a' is then reassigned to 'not here' which is a different object. 2 variables (a and b) and 2 objects ('hi there' and 'not here'). The output for 'a' is "not here" while 'b' is still assigned to "hi there". 

Ex. 2 Destructive method calls
------------------------------
a = "hello"     # 'a' is initialized to object "hello"
b = a           # 'b' is initialized to object 'a'
b << " world"   # '<<' destructive method call 

p a             # => "hello world"
p b             # => "hello world"

Local variable 'a' is assigned to object "hello". Local variable 'b' is assigned to 'a' which points to the same object. Line 26 shows a shovel operator which is a destructive method call. Since, both 'a' and 'b' were pointing to the same object, the destructive method modifies both of of their objects.

## Working with collections (array, hash, string) and popular collection methods.
What is a collection?
- A collection is a type of data structure that refers to arrays, hashes or strings.

String
- A list of characters in a specific sequence. Strings are surrounded by parentheseses.
Ex. "Hello there"

Array 
- An array is an ordered list of elements that can be of any type (strings, booleans, or integers). The data is surrounded by brackets.
Ex. ["hello", 2, true, false]

Hash
- A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys. Entries in a hash are often referred to as key-value pairs. The entries are surrounded by curly braces.
Ex. { superman: "Clark Kent" } or { :superman => "Clark Kent" }

Difference b/n Array and Hash? 
- Order 
- Index vs key retrieval
- Arrays can have duplicates but hash "keys" are unique. Can only have 1 key in a hash of the same value. 

# Popular Collection Methods 
* Each - Iterates and loops through a collection (arrays and hashes). 
* Map - Returns a new array based on the transformation specified in the block. returns a new array based on the blocks *return value*. Each element is transformed based on the return value. 
* Select - If the return value evaluates to true, then the element is sected.  returns a new array based on the blocks *return value*.

==================================================================================================

## puts and return
- puts has a return value of nil. It's just printing things to the screen. 
- return allows you to stop the execution flow of a method and return a specific value. 

==================================================================================================

## false and nil

==================================================================================================

## Method definition and Method invocation
- Definition is when we define a ruby method using the def key-word. 
- Invocation is when we call an existing method using the Core API or calling on the one that we made in our program. 

Ex. 

def dog 
  "loud bark"
end

Initialize the 'dog' method between the def..end block.
